Point 3D
---------

Built with: opengl, glut, 

This was my first step into 3D and eventually gaming.
Point 3D is a tool to load up models(defined in .vtx files) and apply the transformation (rotation, scaling, position) over the loaded model.

The entire code is written into one file, and the application consists of Four Pages.

FirstPage: displays options
	- 1 for Load predefined model (Second page)
	- 2 for defining your own model. (Third Page)
	- 3 for Help (Help Page)

Second Pages: 
    - asks for the name of the model you wish to load.
	- loads up the requested model(.vtx).
	- shifts to view controls (you use controls (Arrow Keys to rotate, ) to rotate the model loaded).

Third Page:
	- Keep entering values (3D vertex form) till your heart content.
	- shifts to view controls (you use controls (Arrow Keys to rotate, ) to rotate the model created).
	
Fourth Page:
	- Simulation of gravity. Forms a trajectory of a particle acting under gravity.
